Fonts
I looked for cinema feleing in my fonts and after some googleing I decided on Limelight for my larger font sizes and Merriweather for the smaller ones. Limelight is connected to theatre and filmmaking as per its description, and Merriweather was suggested in this blog post: https://wpmudev.com/blog/more-google-font-combinations-for-you-to-use/.

Colours
For my colour scheme, I want to convey a home theater feeling so I took my inspiration from articles about which colours would be good when you build a theater room. Red chairs came to mind, and otherwise dark colours for walls. And some yellow details to mimic the spotlight. I read this article https://www.happypaintingcompany.com/blog/the-top-5-best-home-theater-paint-colors/ and landed on the following palette:
black, navy, deep red, yellow.
